        Reduced power consumption with programmable clock prescaler
    Oscillator:
        On-chip oscillator and clock circuitry
        Supports external clock source or crystal
    Programmability:
        In-System Programming (ISP) via bootloader
        On-chip Watchdog Timer (WDT)

    Pin Configuration:
    The AT89S52 microcontroller comes in a 40-pin Dual Inline Package (DIP), with the following pin functions:
    Port 0 (P0.0 – P0.7): Multiplexed low-order address/data bus during accesses to external memory; otherwise, general I/O.
    Port 1 (P1.0 – P1.7): General I/O pins.
    Port 2 (P2.0 – P2.7): High-order address bus during accesses to external memory; otherwise, general I/O.
    Port 3 (P3.0 – P3.7): General I/O and additional functions like serial input/output (RxD, TxD), 
    external interrupts (INT0, INT1), timer inputs (T0, T1), and write/read control lines (WR, RD).
