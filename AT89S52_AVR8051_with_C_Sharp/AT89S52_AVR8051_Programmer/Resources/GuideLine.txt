Firstly, you must have to upload a dedicated ISP HEX file to make your Arduino Board as a Programmer.

Click the "Upload (.hex)" button.

If your Arduino Board is already Connected, you will be asked to disconnect.

If your Arduino Board is already Disconnected, stay disconnected.

Browse the necessary files (Programmer.exe, ChipConfig.conf, ISP.hex) properly.

Then click the "Find Port" button. 

A message will appear and ask you to connect your Arduino Board within 30 seconds.

If you don't connect within the time limit, it will ask you to connect again.

After connecting properly, you will see the connected port.

Click the "Flash" button.

It will flash the dedicated ISP HEX file to your Arduino Board and it act like a ISP Programmer.

Then you can upload any HEX file for AT89S52.
